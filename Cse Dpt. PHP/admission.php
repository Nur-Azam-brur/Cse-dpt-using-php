      <p class="b">
      Degree Offered: Bachelor of Science (BSc), 4-year Program.<br><br><br>
      
      The admission process for prospective undergraduate students is <b>not</b> directly handled by the department authority.
      Therefore, we <b>strongly recommend</b> that you go through the Official BRUR Website for information regarding admission procedures and related announcements. 
      However, you will find  a brief guideline about the process on this page.<br>
      
      Currently, there are <b>six units</b> through which a student can select the subject after appearing in the admission exams. 
      These exams are quite competitive as the number of available seats are limited. 
      The department of Computer Science and Engineering in Begum Rokeya University, Rangpur, also known as CSE BRUR, is under Faculty of Engineering and Technology and the admission seeking students must appear in the <b>E unit</b> exam for admission. 
      There are <b>45</b> seats in CSE BRUR. The process of admission starts after the result of Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) or equivalent (in case of O/A level and International students) Examination of all education board. As part of that process, 
      the admission committee publishes circular for the admission on national newspapers and  University's official website.<br><br><br>

      </tr>
      
      </table><br><br><br>
      </div>
      
      There are some rules and regulations must be followed by the applicants.
      The students must be from <b>science group</b> obtaining  at least <b>GPA 3.5 (as of 2016)</b> in both Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary 
      Certificate (HSC) or equivalent Examination.<br><br>
      
      After the admission examination, a merit list will be published based on the score of the exam and the summation of credits of SSC and HSC exams. 
      Note that, a student can be admitted in the department of Computer Science and Engineering based on the students merit position and  a minimum 
      score of 15 in both the Physics and Mathematic and minimum 7 in English on the test. However, the admission requirements are changed over years 
      and are published on the University website. Please visit Official Page of Admission Test @BRUR for details about the admission of the upcoming 
      session.<br><br><br>
